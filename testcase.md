Here's a set of test cases to cover various aspects of your distance measurement system:

1. **Test Case: Valid Distance Measurement**
   - Input: Simulate a distance measurement within the expected range (e.g., 20 cm).
   - Expected Output: Ensure the average distance is calculated correctly and falls within the expected range. Verify that the correct value is sent to Blynk.

2. **Test Case: Trigger Pulse**
   - Input: Check the duration of the trigger pulse.
   - Expected Output: Ensure that the trigger pulse duration is within the expected range (2 microseconds).

3. **Test Case: Speed of Sound Calculation**
   - Input: Simulate different durations obtained from the echo pin.
   - Expected Output: Verify that the calculation of distance from the duration of the echo pulse is accurate and consistent.

4. **Test Case: Blynk Communication**
   - Input: Verify Blynk connection and data transmission.
   - Expected Output: Ensure that Blynk.begin() initializes successfully with the provided authentication token and Wi-Fi credentials. Verify that the average distance is correctly sent to the Blynk app.

5. **Test Case: Threshold Detection**
   - Input: Vary the average distance to be less than and greater than the threshold (e.g., 10 cm).
   - Expected Output: Verify that the digital pin 25 is set to HIGH when the average distance is less than 10 cm and set to LOW otherwise.

6. **Test Case: Stability and Performance**
   - Input: Continuously monitor the system for an extended period.
   - Expected Output: Ensure that the system operates reliably without memory leaks or crashes over time. Check for performance issues such as delays in distance measurement or Blynk communication.

7. **Test Case: Error Handling**
   - Input: Introduce potential error scenarios, such as loss of Wi-Fi connection or sensor malfunction.
   - Expected Output: Verify that the system gracefully handles errors, provides appropriate error messages (if applicable), and attempts to recover or mitigate the issue.

8. **Test Case: Boundary Conditions**
   - Input: Test the system with extreme conditions, such as maximum and minimum distance readings.
   - Expected Output: Ensure that the system behaves correctly and does not produce unexpected results or errors near the boundaries of its operating range.

By systematically testing these scenarios, you can ensure that your distance measurement system functions correctly under various conditions and provides accurate results.
